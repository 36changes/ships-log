## The OpenSea Ship's Log

A page listing recent auctions and bids on OpenSea, with the ability to buy items on sale right from the page.

### Demo

Check out a live version of this example [here](https://ships-log.herokuapp.com).

### Instructions

To install dependencies:
```JavaScript
npm install
```

To run the app on localhost:

```JavaScript
npm start
```

### Directory structure

`public` houses favicon and base index.html – there should be little reason to use this directory.

`src` contains the app's js entry point and a simple CSS file
